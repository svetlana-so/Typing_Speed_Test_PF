### Typing Test Application

The Typing Test Application is a simple web-based tool designed to help you improve your typing speed and accuracy. This application fetches random text from an API and challenges you to type the text as quickly and accurately as possible within a time limit. It provides feedback on typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy, helping users track their progress.

## Features
Typing Challenge: You are presented with a random set of words to type within a set time limit.

Timer: A countdown timer is displayed on the screen, and when time runs out, the input is disabled.

Word Highlighting: As you type, the characters you type are highlighted in the displayed text for better visualization.

WPM Calculation: The application calculates and displays the typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

Accuracy Measurement: It also measures and displays the accuracy in typing, showing what percentage of words were typed correctly.

Restart and Reset: You can restart the typing challenge to practice again, or you can reset the test to start over with a fresh text sample.

Progress Tracking: The application allows you to track the progress and compare your performance over multiple attempts.
