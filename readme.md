Typing Test Application
*Overview*
The Typing Test Application is a simple web-based tool designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. This application fetches random text from an API and challenges users to type the text as quickly and accurately as possible within a time limit. It provides feedback on typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy, helping users track their progress.

*Features*
Typing Challenge: Users are presented with a random set of words to type within a set time limit.

Timer: A countdown timer is displayed on the screen, and when time runs out, the user's input is disabled.

Word Highlighting: As users type, the characters they type are highlighted in the displayed text for better visualization.

WPM Calculation: The application calculates and displays the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

Accuracy Measurement: It also measures and displays the user's accuracy in typing, showing what percentage of words were typed correctly.

Restart and Reset: Users can restart the typing challenge to practice again, or they can reset the test to start over with a fresh text sample.

Progress Tracking: The application allows users to track their progress and compare their performance over multiple attempts.
